Loupe Agent for ASP.NET MVC 4 and Web API
===================

This agent adds Loupe to your ASP.NET MVC 4 web site to automatically record performance
and health information for your MVC and Web API application.  If you don't need
to modify the source code just download the latest [Loupe Agent for ASP.NET MVC]().  
It extends the [Loupe Agent](https://nuget.org/packages/Gibraltar.Agent/) so you can 
use any viewer for Loupe to review the agent's information
